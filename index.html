<h1>Birdy Help</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Common questions and answers</p>

<details>
<summary>Why does Birdy need Screen Time access?</summary>
<p>Birdy uses Apple’s Screen Time permission to block selected apps during focus sessions and scheduled sessions. This happens entirely on your device — Birdy does not see what apps you use or collect any usage data.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>An app wasn’t blocked — why?</summary>
<p>iOS may temporarily pause blocking after a device restart, system update, or if Screen Time permission was removed. Opening Birdy once usually restores blocking immediately.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>My scheduled session didn’t start</summary>
<p>This is almost always caused by Screen Time permission being turned off by iOS. Open Birdy and check permissions — once re-enabled, schedules will run automatically again.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>I didn’t get a notification</summary>
<p>Make sure notifications are allowed for Birdy in iOS Settings. Focus sessions still run even if notifications are disabled — you just won’t see the reminder.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do App Limits work?</summary>
<p>App Limits let you allow a certain number of opens per day. After that, Birdy gently blocks the app to help you stick to your intention.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do Scheduled Sessions work?</summary>
<p>You choose times when distractions should be blocked automatically. Birdy will run these sessions every day without needing you to remember.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do breaks work?</summary>
<p>You can pause a session anytime. When the break ends, Birdy resumes blocking automatically.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I restore my subscription?</summary>
<p>Open Settings → Restore Purchases. This reconnects your Birdy Plus access if you changed device or reinstalled the app.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I cancel Birdy Plus?</summary>
<p>Subscriptions are managed by Apple. Go to your iPhone Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions → Birdy.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Birdy collect my data?</summary>
<p>No. Birdy does not collect personal data, track usage, or store your activity. Everything happens locally on your device.</p>
